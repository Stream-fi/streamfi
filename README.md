# Streamfi
### The project has the following objectives:

### Creating/Managing Streams
The primary goal is to allow the users to create
token streams for various applications like Salaries, Subscriptions. etc. and also
create a receiving party dashboard for the same.

### Dollar Cost Averaging
DCA, in simpler terms is reducing user risk by
swapping/buying tokens along the curve at regular intervals rather than doing
so in a chunk. This essentially buys the token at an “average cost”. As an added
benefit, diverging your orders reduces slippage for traders, which becomes a
huge problems for DEX pools with limited liquidity.

## Problems Solved:

1. Bringing traditional finance applications like multiple accounts with “saving”
opportunities to Defi.

2. Providing a platform to users to unleash the functionality of creating streams for
salaries, memberships, and anything they wish to create with those streams.

3. Providing Novice users a “safer” gateway into Defi with DCA so that they do not
have to worry about fluctuation in prices and slippages.

4. To promote the use of streams in the ecosystem. Using streams instead of
chunks helps reduce volatility of assets, inducing more trust in the ecosystem as
a whole.
